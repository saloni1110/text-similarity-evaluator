following checks need to be done on each column to ensure data is proper. For each of these checks, functions are already defined which \n        will be called. You just need to identify those checks which are relevant for each column.\n            Include constraints such as:\n        1. **Type Validation**: Confirm that all values match the expected data type.\n        2. **Range Validation**: Define valid minimum and maximum values based on the data description and observed range.\n        3. **Missing Value Handling**: Specify whether missing values are allowed.\n        4. **Unique Constraints**: Identify columns that must have unique values (e.g., IDs).\n        5. **Categorical Restrictions**: Verify if values must belong to a predefined set of categories.\n        6. **Pattern Matching**: For strings, define required patterns (e.g., regex for emails or specific formats like YYYY-MM-DD).\n        7. **Statistical Properties**: Add constraints for numeric columns based on observed statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation).\n        8. **Outlier Detection**: Specify constraints to identify or remove values significantly deviating from typical data points.\n        9. **Logical Constraints**: Define rules based on relationships or dependencies between columns (e.g., date_of_birth must precede date_of_joining).\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        Provide the output in **strictly pipe-separated format** with two columns: `column_name` and `Validation Rule`. Each row should represent a column and its validation rule(s). Do not create any extra columns. Use a separate row for each rule if a column has multiple rules.\n\n        ### Example of Pipe-Separated Output:\n        column_name | Validation_Rule \n        age | Must be an integer \n        age | Must be between 18 and 100 name  \n        email | Must follow the format [A-Za-z]+ \n        email | Must follow the format\n\n        ### Note:\n        - Do not include additional text, comments, or explanations outside the pipe-separated format.\n        - Ensure that the output is properly aligned for readability.\n        ",
